web-developer-interview-task
============================

Example mini web-framework written in pure PHP v5.3.

This is a work - a result of my interview tasks to several companies which accepted me. 
Initially, it's a mini-framework written in PHP v5.3 with a web form that validates, 
and writes data to a file storage. There's a minimal OOD, and this was built in some 14 hours, 
with extensibility in mind. 
The code is pretty clean, so there shouldn't be much issues with cross-browser compatibility. 
Tested with FF, Chrome and IE (current versions of the release time).
